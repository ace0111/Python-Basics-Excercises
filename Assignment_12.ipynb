    "1. The PdfFileReader() and PdfFileWriter() File objects should be opened in binary mode, with the 'rb' and 'wb' mode arguments respectively.\n",
    "2. To get a Page object for page 5 from a PdfFileReader object, you can use the `getPage()` method and pass in the index of the page (which starts at 0). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   page5 = pdf_reader.getPage(4)  # get Page object for page 5 (index 4)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The PdfFileReader variable that stores the number of pages in the PDF document is `numPages`.\n",
    "4. Before obtaining Page objects from an encrypted PDF using a PdfFileReader object, you must first decrypt it by calling the `decrypt()` method and passing in the password as a string argument. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pdf_reader.decrypt('swordfish')  # decrypt the PDF with password 'swordfish'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To rotate a page in a PDF document, you can use the `rotateClockwise()` or `rotateCounterClockwise()` methods of the Page object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   page.rotateClockwise(90)  # rotate page 90 degrees clockwise\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. A Paragraph object represents a single paragraph of text in a Word document, while a Run object represents a contiguous run of text within a paragraph with a single style.\n",
    "7. To obtain a list of Paragraph objects for a Document object stored in a variable named `doc`, you can use the `paragraphs` attribute of the Document object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   paragraphs = doc.paragraphs  # get a list of Paragraph objects\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. The `Font` object in the `docx` module has the `bold`, `underline`, `italic`, `strike`, and `outline` variables.\n",
    "9. `True` indicates that the formatting is turned on for the bold property, `False` indicates that it is turned off, and `None` indicates that the property is not explicitly set and should use the default value.\n",
    "10. To create a new Word document, you can use the `Document()` function provided by the `docx` module. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    from docx import Document\n",
    "    doc = Document()  # create a new Word document\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "11. To add a paragraph with the text 'Hello, there!' to a Document object stored in a variable named `doc`, you can use the `add_paragraph()` method and pass in the text as a string argument. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    doc.add_paragraph('Hello, there!')  # add a new paragraph to the document\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. The levels of headings available in Word documents are represented by integers ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 is the title style and 1-9 represent headings of decreasing importance. For example, heading level 1 is represented by the integer 1, heading level 2 is represented by the integer 2, and so on."
