    "\n",
    "1. An empty dictionary's code looks like this: {}.\n",
    "2. The value of a dictionary value with the key 'foo' and the value 42 would look like this: {'foo': 42}.\n",
    "3. The most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list is that a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, while a list is an ordered collection of values.\n",
    "4. If you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}, you will get a KeyError because 'foo' is not a valid key in the spam dictionary.\n",
    "5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, the expression 'cat' in spam checks whether 'cat' is a key in the dictionary, while 'cat' in spam.keys() explicitly checks for the presence of the 'cat' key.\n",
    "6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, the expression 'cat' in spam checks whether 'cat' is a key in the dictionary, while 'cat' in spam.values() checks whether 'cat' is a value in the dictionary (i.e., whether 'cat' appears in at least one of the values).\n",
    "7. A shortcut for the given code would be to use the defaultdict class from the collections module. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "spam = defaultdict(lambda: 'black')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a new dictionary with a default value of 'black' for any missing keys. So if 'color' is not in spam, the expression `spam['color']` will automatically return 'black'.\n",
    "8. The module and function used to pretty print dictionary values is `pprint.pprint()`. To use this function, you first need to import the `pprint` module. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pprint\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}\n",
    "pprint.pprint(my_dict)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will display the dictionary with each key-value pair on a separate line, indented for clarity.\n",
    "    \n"
